The Gurkhas have had a very raw deal, and I’m surprised by the way the government is dragging its feet on this one. The government claims that if they allowed all veterans to stay then [**Britain would be flooded with 100,00 new Gurkha citizens**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/05/04/gurkhas-invasion-talk-mad-115875-21330608/). I seriously doubt this. But, even if they all did decide to come to the UK, then they would deserve it anyway.

Nick Clegg [**summed it up nicely**](http://www.nickclegg.com/2009/04/vote-against-gurkha-ruling/),

> _People who are prepared to fight and die for our country should be entitled to live here._

I completely agree with him. If the government isn’t prepared to make good on this entitlement then perhaps they shouldn’t be asking Gurkhas to contribute to Britain’s wars.

The sci-fi film _Starship Troopers_ has brilliant propaganda snippets on this very theme – **_Service Guarantees Citizenship: Would you like to know more?_**
