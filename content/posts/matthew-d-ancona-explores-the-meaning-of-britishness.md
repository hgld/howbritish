title = "Matthew d’Ancona explores the meaning of ‘Britishness’"

+++
I’m looking forward to Matthew d’Ancona’s radio series on Britishness. He explores whether Britishness is the glue that can hold us all together or just a word that has lost its meaning.

If you’re resident in the UK then you will be able to listen to this on BBC Radio 4 at 9am on Tue 31 Mar 2009 or on the [**BBC iPlayer.**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jcjjp)
