It’s three years this month since the controversial British citizenship test was launched to decide whether those applying for a UK passport have a good enough knowledge of life in this to country to become British.

To mark the ominous anniversary, a new pub quiz version of the controversial test is this week being unveiled.

And where better to test our Britishness than a traditional British boozer?

But how would the regulars in your local hostelry fair? Would your drinking mates pass the test with flying colours? Find out by downloading the quiz pack. Send us the results from your pub and we’ll report on the final results.
