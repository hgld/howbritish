But according to a [**recent poll**](http://www.onepoll.com/press-archive/England-least-patriotic-country), only one in three English men and women knew the date when St George’s Day is celebrated and more than forty per cent were clueless as to why he is the patron saint.

The patron saints are one of the few cultural subjects covered in the British citizenship test, however this news highlights how irrelevant the test’s content is.

We’re working to create a [**new citizenship test**](https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=521e&t=521e.40) that truly reflects real knowledge about life in the UK. Click [**here**](https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=521e&t=521e.40) to contribute your own questions and vote for your favourites.
