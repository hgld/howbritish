The BBC reports that Prime Minister Gordon Brown is planning to spend part of his summer break doing voluntary work in his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. A spokesman said:

> The prime minister will be undertaking some community voluntary work during his time in his constituency. For obvious reasons he has agreed with the organisations concerned that any work he does will be private.

Seems a bit odd to me. Does this pledge have anything to do with the recent news to encourage would-be citizens to do voluntary work? It seems too much of a coincidence for it not to be.
