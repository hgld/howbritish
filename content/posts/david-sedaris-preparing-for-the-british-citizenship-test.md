title = "David Sedaris: Preparing for the British citizenship test"

+++
by Henry

I was listening to a great programme called “[**Meet David Sedaris**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rp3fg)” on Radio 4 on Sunday. David reads from his extensive collection of comedy essays, giving his unique perspective on life in London.

In one of the journal segments, David talks about some of the bizarre questions he came across while preparing for the British citizenship test. All of these questions have come from our study guide publications. Listen to the clip below.
