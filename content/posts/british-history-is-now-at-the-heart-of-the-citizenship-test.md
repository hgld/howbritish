Today saw the new version of the Life in the UK test launched by the government. The Life in the UK test has now been revised to include new testable materials covering British history.

With a complete new chapter added to the testable materials this means there are hundreds more facts to be tested. Whilst the government have announced the new testable chapter they have not provided any sample questions for students.

With the government committed to reducing net migration to under 100,000 by the end of Parliament it is unsurprising that they have made the test harder like this. However, the questions still remain â€“ does the test teach the kinds of things that will help them become British, and how can a a test reflect the national identity?

Test yourself on the new British citizenship test material [**here**](http://lifeintheuk.net/quiz/life3) with our [**sample questions**](http://lifeintheuk.net/quiz/life3). Do you know enough to be British?
