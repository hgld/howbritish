[**Monica Ali**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Ali) writes in [**The Atlantic**](https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908/ali-british) about the British citizenship test and how it fails to present a true picture of the real Britain.

> I remember taking one of the online tests that immediately sprang up, to see if I knew enough to be truly British. I did fine on the historical questions. The other stuff was trickier. I couldn’t name the four national saint’s days in order (Saints David, Patrick, George, and Andrew). PG, I guessed, was one of the nation’s favorite brands of teabags. It is—but in the book, _PG_ was the “Parental Guidance” part of the cinema classification system. I did guess right that if we spill someone’s pint in the pub, what we are supposed to do is offer to buy them another. (Although I had been tempted to plump for another option, which was to prepare for a fight in the car park. That might be more accurate, in certain pubs at least.)
