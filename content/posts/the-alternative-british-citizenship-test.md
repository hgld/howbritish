Simon from Norfolk has written his own [**alternative version of the British citizenship test**](http://www.merebagatelle.com/index.php/2009/08/the-alternative-british-citizenship-test/). It’s a mix of popular culture and humour – which is exactly what is missing from the official test. Here are some of my favourites:

> _1) Did you see the game last night? (Pick one)  
> a: Yes, what were Chelsea playing at?  
> b: Yes, what were Arsenal playing at?  
> c: Yes, I really fancied the labrador but it seems it was the spaniel’s night.  
> d: No I was busy working and contributing to the economy._
>
> _2) What do the following have in common: The Queen, turkey, Noel Edmunds, silly hats?  
> a: They’re all things that Prince Phillip has shot at.  
> b: They’re all traditional elements of a Proper British Christmas Day.  
> c: They’re all things that you require a licence to transport on a public highway.  
> d: They’re all sacred to the Church of England._
>
> _3) Barker is to Corbett as Wise is to?  
> a: Morecambe  
> b: Whitley Bay  
> c: Southend  
> d: Lowestoft_
