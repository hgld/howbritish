Guardian reader [**Sirorfeo**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/sirorfeo) provides some interesting revelations on the initial draft of Great British Values (as photographed through a transparent folder on Downing Street).

> _THE THIRTEEN BRITISH COMMANDMENTS \[… would ‘Common Values’ sound better? G.B.\]_
>
> _– Thou shalt celebrate the day of our patron Saint George every year, come rain or shine, on April the…. \[to consult with Culture Secretary\]  
> – Thou shalt lament the rain in the winter, and dread the heat of the summer \[… should this be humidity? -G.B.\].  
> – Thou shalt strive for fairness and equality in all walks of public life, via a series of statutory instruments signed by our unelected and hereditary monarch  
> – Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and inform on him for dog-fouling.  
> – Thou shalt whinge incessantly about inadequate public services, whilst simultaneously refusing to pay any more tax.  
> – Thou shalt for thine own safety and security carry ID cards, the data on which will be duly misplaced by an errant contractor._
